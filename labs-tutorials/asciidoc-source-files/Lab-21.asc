= Lab 21.0 – Testing

== Objective

Add unit tests to the Yamba application.

== Overview

In this lab, we will cover the following concepts:

* Creating a basic unit test

* Running unit tests

NOTE: Android uses the jUnit 3 framework for unit testing.

== Steps

. Create unit test for YambaClient getTimeline
. Create unit test for StatusActivity
. Access YambaApplication

== Detailed Steps

. Create the directory to contain unit tests.

.. Inside the module you want to test, navigate to the "src" directory.

.. Create a new directory called "androidTest".  This will be at the same level as the "main" directory.

.. Inside the "androidTest" directory create a directory called "java".  This is where the unit test code will be placed.

.. Inside "java" create a package with the same value as in your "main/java" directory.  Use the package wizard.
+
NOTE: Using the same package name is not required but ensures that the test classes
have the save "visibility" as the classes under test.

. Create a unit test.  Unit tests will be placed in the java package under the "androidTest" directory.
Unit tests are created as java code.

.. In +src/androidTest/java/com.thenewcircle.yamba+ create a java class named "SimpleAndroidTest"
+
Select "New -> Java Class".  There is not a wizard for unit tests in Android Studio.

.. Extend the +AndroidTestCase+ class
+
[source, java]
----
public class SimpleAndroidTest extends AndroidTestCase {
}
----

.. And a method call +testGetTimeline+
+
[source, java]
----
public void testGetTimeline() {
		fail("Not yet implemented");
}
----
+
NOTE: This follows the "fail first" strategy of unit testing

. Run the unit test and verify that it fails.  You must create a run configuration to run the test.

.. Select "Run -> Edit Configurations" from the top level menu.

.. Select "+" to add a new run configuration and select "Android Tests"

. Add Android Test
+

.. Define the test by entering the following values in the wizard:
+
[cols="2", width="50%"]
|===
|Name |SimpleAndroidTest
|Module|app
|Test|Class
|Class|com.thenewcircle.yamba.SimpleAndroidTest
|Specific instrumentation runner|blank
|Target Device |Show chooser dialog
|===
+
The wizard should look like this:
+
image::images/lab-21-configuration-2.png[width="50%"]

.. Run "SimpleAndroidTest" using the play button.
+
Under the "Run" tab at the bottom of the screen you should see the jRunner output:
+
.Runner Output
image::images/lab-21-runner.png[width="50%"]
+
NOTE: The test failed because you forced it to.

. Create a working test

.. Select "Run -> Edit Configurations" from the top level menu.
+
[source, java]
----
public void testGetTimeline() {
		Context context = getContext();
		... get timeline ...
    assertTrue(timeline.size() > 0);
		assertEquals(20, timeline.size());
}
----

.. Run "SimpleAndroidTest" again using the play button.
+
Under the "Run" tab at the bottom of the screen you should see the jRunner output:
+
.Runner Output
image::images/lab-21-runner-good.png[width=800]
+
NOTE: This time you should see a green bar to signify that the test worked (Green is clean!!!, Read is dead!!!)

.	Create a unit test for activity UI.  Although you’ve tested the event service directly, as you should also verify that the UI view element that the user sees contains the correct value.  Create a unit test to run the actual activity and inspect the UI element.

.. Create a new jUnit Test Case for the StatusActivity called “StatusActivityTest”.  Extend the activity testing class from:
+
[source, java]
----
public class StatusActivityTest extends
    android.test.ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2<StatusActivity>
----

.. Create a new constructor
+
[source, java]
----
public StatusActivityTest() {
   super("com.thenewcircle.yamba", StatusActivity.class);
}
----

.. Create setup method and an instance variable for the activity.
+
[source, java]
----
StatusActivity statusActivity;

@Override
protected void setUp() throws Exception {
   super.setUp();
   statusActivity = getActivity();
}
----

.. Create a new test method called “testActivityUI” which will lookup the text element and check it’s value.
+
.textActivityUI method
[source,java]
----
public void testActivityUI() {
   TextView count = (TextView) StatusActivity.findViewById(R.id.count);
   assertEquals("140", textView.getText().toString());
}
----

..  Create a new run configuration and un the test until you get a green bar.

.	Code a test application that interacts with a View of the application under test must run in the main application's thread, also known as the UI thread.  The Android testing framework provides an annotation for ensuring that code runs on the main UI thread.  Create the following test method to verify that you can change the value of a UI view:

.. Create a new method called +testView+ and test the value of a view element.
+
Use the following only as a template - your code will probably be different.
+
[source, java]
----
@UiThreadTest
public void testView() {
    TextView status = (TextView) StatusActivity.findViewById(R.id.status);
    TextView count = (TextView) StatusActivity.findViewById(R.id.count);
    assertEquals("140", count.getText().toString());
    status.setText("abc");
    assertEquals("137", count.getText().toString());
}
----

.. Run the test until you get a green bar.
