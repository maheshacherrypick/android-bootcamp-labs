= Lab 1.0 â€“ Create a basic Android App

== Objective
In this lab, we will create a basic Android application.

== Setup
Lab 0 has been done.  Android Studio or ADT with Eclipse should be installed.  Android 19 SDK and associated tools should also be installed.

TIP: SDKs can be installed and updated through Android SDK Manager.

== Steps
. Create a new Android project.
.. Enter the following values in the "New Project" wizard:
+
[cols="2", width="60%"]
|===

|Application Name
|+Yamba+

|Module Name
|+yamba+

|Package Name
|+com.thenewcircle.yamba+

|Project Location
|+<your directory>/YambaProject+

|Minimum Required SDK
|API 15

|Target SDK
|API 19

|Compile With
|API 19

|===

. Remove the +Hello World+ from the default activity.
+
TIP:  Android studio does not explicitly use fragments when creating a blank activity.  Eclipse does, so when using Eclipse, create an empty activity so that you don't end up with fragments at this step.

. Add a new +EditText+ :
+
[cols="2", width="40%"]
|===

|ID
|+editTextStatusMessage+

|===
. Add a new Button:
+
[cols="2", width="40%"]
|===

|ID
|+buttonPostStatus+

|Text
|+Post Status+

|===

. Adjust the views so that the button does not appear on top of the text.
Add the following code to the +Button+ element:

[source, xml]
----
android:layout_below="@id/editTextStatusMessage"
----

. Add a hint to the post text field

[source, xml]
----
android:hint="@string/status_hint"
----

NOTE: Be sure to create the value for +status_hint+ in the +strings.xml+ file.
Use something like "What's up.  Enter post text here."
