. Remove the +Hello World+ from the default activity.
+
TIP:  Android studio does not explicitly use fragments when creating a blank activity.  Eclipse does, so when using Eclipse, create an empty activity so that you don't end up with fragments at this step.

. Add a new +EditText+ :
+
[cols="2", width="40%"]
|===

|ID
|+editTextStatusMessage+

|===
. Add a new Button:
+
[cols="2", width="40%"]
|===

|ID
|+buttonPostStatus+

|Text
|+Post Status+
