android-bootcamp-labs
=====================

The purpose of this repo is to be the de facto standard of writing the lab work for the Android Bootcamp class.

Please do not commit source code in this repository.

1. If there are bugs, let me know and I will fix them.
2. If there are missing features, let me know and I will add them.
3. When I do a new commit I will erase all of the changes you have made.
4. The order of commits and the work done is more important than any attempt to "clean up" the code at any particular step.
5. The evolution of the code base is more important than the final product.
6. This is supposed to be the de facto standard, any surplus side-projects or changes for other classes should be committed to a separate fork.
